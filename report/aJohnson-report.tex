\section{Introduction}
The goal of this work is to introduce and explain the code written for the MATH6641 project.
The time-dependent one-dimensional neutron transport equation was solved using the discrete 
ordinates formulation \cite{lewis1984computational} using discontinuous-Galerkin in space, and
explicit Euler for time.
The project was written in Python and works best with 3.5\footnote{not tested on other versions}
and is included with this report in \texttt{fesnt.py}.
This report, and the code included, are covered with the GNU Public License, found in \texttt{LICENSE}.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The discrete-ordinates formulation of the neutron transport equation chooses to solve for the angular
neutron flux, $\psi(x, \mu, t)$ along a discrete set of $N$ angles $\vec{\mu}$. A quadrature set of 
weights and angles is chosen to satisfy some physical constraints, briefly summarized here:
\begin{subequations} 
    \label{eq:quadRules}
    \begin{equation}
        \mu_m = -\mu_{N-m+1}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        w_m = w_{N-m+1}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_m w_m = 2
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{-1}^1f(x, \mu)d\mu\approx\sum_mw_m f(x, \mu_m)
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The weights and angles are, for this work, chosen from a Guass-Legendre polynomial set.
%TODO: verify and cite
Select sets of weights and angles are listed in \cref{sec:qsets}

This project seeks to solve the following initial-boundary value problem:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ibvpNTE}
    \frac{1}{\nu}\dpmdt+\mu_m\dpmdx+\sigma_t(x)\psi(x, t) = 
    \sigma_S(x)\phi(x, t), \tfor a<x<b,t>0, \mu_m\in\vec{\mu}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x, t) = \sum_mw_m\psi_m(x, t)
\end{equation}
and $\sigma_S(x) =\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_s(x) + \fisTrms(x)\right)$.

\Cref{eq:ibvpNTE} is subject to initial and boundary conditions
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \psi_m(x, 0) = \psi_{m,0}(x), \tfor a<x<b, \mu_m\in\vec{\mu}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \psi_m(a, t) = \Gamma_a(\mu_m, t)\tfor \mu_m>0,t>0
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \psi_m(b, t) = \Gamma_b(\mu_m, t)\tfor\mu_m<0, t>0
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The report is laid out as follows. \Cref{sec:derive} derives the numerical scheme implemented
for this project. \Cref{sec:implement} gives some insight into the actual implementation
and usage needed to reproduce the results. \Cref{sec:results} presents results from
three test cases of increasing difficulty.

\section{Derivation of the Method} \label{sec:derive}
The author set out to apply a finite-element scheme for the spatial domain, with an implicit Euler
scheme in time. This section shall detail the mathematical foundation for the project, and present the
numeric scheme that was ultimately implemented for this work.

\subsection{Notation}
Following the work of Reed and Hill \cite{wReed1973}, 
the author set out to apply a Discontinuous-Galerkin (DG) method for the spatial domain.
This required subdividing the domain $a<x<b$ into non-overlapping elements $\tau$.
The \tfes $\mfesv$ was chosen to be piece-wise quadratic polynomials that are continuous 
within a single element.

\subsubsection{Finite-Element Spaces}
The following \tfes was used for the trial functions that approximated $\psi(x,\mu, t)$ within an
element $\tau$. Let $\mfesv$ be the space
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:vhspace}
    \begin{split}
        \mfesv = \lbrace \fepsim\vert & \fepsim \text{ is piece-wise quadratic}, \\
            & \fepsim(a, \mu, t) = 
                \begin{cases}
                    \Gamma_a(\mu, t), \text{ if } \mu>0\\
                    0,\text{ otherwise}
                \end{cases}, \\
            & \fepsim(b, \mu, t) = 0 \rbrace
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

For this work, the test functions used to create the \tfem were of the piece-wise quadratic within each
mesh and taken to be
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:testfuncs}
    \eta_i(x) = x^i
\end{equation}
which, for $i\leq2$, is contained within $\mfesv$.

\subsubsection{Quadratic Flux}
Within each element $\tau$, the flux was represented as a quadratic function using the element boundaries and 
midpoint of the element.
Specifically, the angular flux was represented using Lagrange interpolating polynomials, as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fluxPoly}
    \fepsim(x) = \sum_{j=0}^2\fepsimj\sum_{l=0}^2\ajl x^l
    = \sum_{j=0}^2\fepsimj\prod_{l=0,l\neq j}^2\frac{x-x_l}{x_j-x_l}
\end{equation}
This way, given three internal points of element $\tau$, the Lagrange coefficients
$\ajl$ could be determined, meaning that amplitudes $\fepsimj$ remained to
be solved.
Using this notation, the spatial derivative of the flux is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fluxDeriv}
    \pdiff{\fepsim}{x} = \sum_{j=0}^2\fepsimj\sum_{l=1}^2l\ajl x^{l-1}
\end{equation}
The benefit of using Lagrange polynomials is that, at a specific lattice site $x_l$, the 
angular flux evaluates to the specific polynomial amplitude, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\psi}_m(x_j) =\fepsimj 
\end{equation}

Using a quadratic representation of the flux within an element allows the use of Simpson's
integration without introducing additional error, as such a method is exact for polynomials
of order 2 or less.
According to Simpson's rule, the spatial integral of a function can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:simpsInt}
    \int_a^bf(x)dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2}\left(f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{b-a}{2}\right) + f(b)\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Upwind/Downwind Elements}
The scheme implemented iterates through all angles in the quadrature set, and marches through
elements in a manner akin to following the wind-direction. When $mu$ is less than zero, this 
translates to moving left along the $x$ axis, and the first mesh is taken to be the mesh
with an edge at $x=b$. 
Such a scheme requires distinctions to be made between upwind and downwind sides, as will be utilized
heavily in later sections. \Cref{fig:upwDnw} describes the upwind side of the edges of element $\tau$
as $-$ sides, and downwind sides as $+$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \input{./femNotation.tex}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Notation used to denote upwind and downwind elements given flux angle $\mu$}
    \label{fig:upwDnw}
\end{figure}

Using this distinction, the jump of a function across an element edge is defined with
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        V^+ = \lim_{s\rightarrow 0^+}V(x+s\mu)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        V^- = \lim_{s\rightarrow 0^-}V(x+s\mu)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:jumpDef}
        \jump{V(x)} = V^+-V^-
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Finite-Element Method}

Given these definitions, the process for deriving the \tfem can begin. 
To start, multiply \cref{eq:ibvpNTE} by a test function $\eta_i\in\mfesv$ and integrating over
the spatial domain $\Omega=[a,b]$.
If the spatial discretization $\mathcal{T}_h$ does not cross material boundaries, then cross sections $\sigma_S$
are constant within an element.
The finite element will seek to approximate
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:derive0}
    \sumTaus\left[
        \invv\tauInt{\dpmdt}{\eta}
        +\mu_m\tauInt{\dpmdx}{\eta}
        +\sigma_{t,\tau}\tauInt{\psi_m}{\eta}
    \right]
    = \sumTaus\sigma_S\tauInt{\phi}{\eta}
    \forEtaInV
\end{equation}

By integrating the spatial derivative term by parts, the derivative can be shifted off
the true function $\psi$\footnote{assumed to be sufficiently smooth}.
\begin{equation}
    \tauInt{\dpmdt}{\eta} = \left.\left[\overset{*}{\psi_m}\inTau{\eta}\right]\right\vert_{\tau_a}^{\tau_b}
        -\tauInt{\psi_m}{\ddx{\inTau{\eta}}}
\end{equation}

Here, caution must be taken to ensure that the test function is evaluated \textit{inside} the
element $\tau$.
Since $\psi_m$ is sufficiently smooth, we can take the upwind information $\overset{*}{\psi_m}=\fepsim^-$,
but choosing $\inTau{\eta}$ to always be inside the element.
Another integration by parts, replacing $\psi_m\rightarrow\fepsim$ as the derivative has been removed
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:derive1}
    \tauInt{\fepsim}{\ddx{\inTau{\eta}}}=\left.\left(
        \overset{**}\psi_m\inTau{\eta}
    \right)\right|_{\tau_a}^{\tau_b}
    -\tauInt{\inTau{\ddx{\fepsim}}}{\eta}
\end{equation}

Here, $\overset{**}{\psi_m}$ must be taken inside $\tau$, yielding
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:derive2}
    \tauInt{\dpmdx}{\eta}\Rightarrow
        \tauInt{\inTau{\ddx{\fepsim}}}{\eta}
        + \left.\left(\left(\overset{*}\psi_m-\overset{**}{\psi_m}\right)\inTau{\eta}\right)
        \right\vert_{\tau_a}^{\tau_b}
\end{equation}

For positive or negative values of $\mu$, different terms in \cref{eq:derive2} will cancel.
For $\mu>0$, 
\begin{equation}
    \overset{**}{\fepsim} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \fepsimm, \text{ on }\tau_b \\
        \fepsimp, \text{ on }\tau_a
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Similarly, for $\mu<0$,
\begin{equation}
    \overset{**}{\fepsim} = 
    \begin{cases}
        \fepsimp, \text{ on }\tau_b \\
        \fepsimm, \text{ on }\tau_a
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Using these definitions, the generalized version of \cref{eq:derive2} approximates to 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:derive3}
    \mu_m\tauInt{\dpmdx}{\eta}\Rightarrow\mu_m\tauInt{\dfpmdx}{\eta}
    + \mabs{\mu_m}\left.\left(\jump{\fepsim}\inTau{\eta}\right)\right|_{\tau^{upw}}
\end{equation}
where $\tau^{upw}$ is taken to be the upwind edge of element $\tau$.

For this project, the time derivative was approximated with an implicit Euler scheme, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:timeDeriv}
    \tauInt{\dpmdt}{\eta}\approx\frac{\fepsim^{n+1}-\fepsim^n}{\Delta t_n}
\end{equation}
and the final \tfem can be written as follows: For all angles $\mu_m\in\vec{\mu}$, find $\fepsim$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:finalFEM}
    \begin{split}
        \sumTaus\left[
            \left(\sigma_t^\tau+\frac{1}{v^\tau\Delta t_n}\right)\tauInt{\fepsim^{n+1}}{\eta}
            +\mu_m\tauInt{\ddx{\fepsim^{n+1}}}{\eta}
            +\mabs{\mu_m}\left.\left(\jump{\fepsim^{n+1}}\inTau{\eta}\right)\right|_{\tau^{upw}}
            \right] \\
        = \sumTaus\left[
            \frac{1}{v^\tau\Delta t_n}\tauInt{\fepsim^n}{\eta}
            +\sigma_S\tauInt{\fephi^{n+1}}{\eta}
            \right]
        \forEtaInV
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\fephi\equiv\sum_mw_m\fepsim$

\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implement}
As discussed in \cref{sec:results}, the scheme presented in \cref{eq:finalFEM} is applied to
various one-dimensional problems. 
A traditional method for solving the discrete-ordinates form of the transport equation 
is to march through meshes along specific angles $\mu$ starting at an incident 
boundary condition \cite{lewis1984computational}.
For this approach, each mesh is solved individually using information taken from
either the upwind mesh, in the form of jump terms, or the relevant boundary conditions.

\subsection{Matrix Formulation}

\Cref{eq:finalFEM} is recast into a linear system that will be solved iteratively, as the
scalar flux $\fephi$ must be evaluated at the same time level as the angular flux $\fepsim$.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:matrixFEM}
    \left[
        \mu_m\asMatrix{A}+\mabs{\mu_m}\asMatrix{B} + \asMatrix{C}
        +\frac{1}{\Delta t_n}\asMatrix{D}
    \right]
    \asVector{\fepsim^{n+1}}
    =\frac{1}{\Delta t_n}\asMatrix{D}\asVector{\fepsim^n}+\asVector{S^{n+1}}
\end{equation}

The where matrices $\asMatrix{A},\asMatrix{B},\asMatrix{C}$ and $\asMatrix{D}$ contain 
coefficients from the following bilinear operators:
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:bilinearA}
        a\bilinear = \tauInt{\ddx{\fepsim^{n+1}}}{\eta}
        \Rightarrow \asVector{a_{ij}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:bilinearB}
        b\bilinear=
        \left.\left(\jump{\fepsim^{n+1}}\inTau{\eta}\right)\right|_{\tau^{upw}}
        \Rightarrow \asVector{b_{ij}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:bilinearC}
        c\bilinear=\sigma_t\tauInt{\fepsim^{n+1}}{\eta}
        \Rightarrow \asVector{c_{ij}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:bilinearD}
        d\bilinear=\frac{1}{v\Delta t_n}\tauInt{\fepsim^{n+1}}{\eta}
        \Rightarrow \asVector{d_{ij}}
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

In each of the following examples, the variable $\xi_j$ refers to the vector of coefficients
from Simpson's integration: $\asVector{\xi}\equiv\left[0.5, 2.0, 0.5\right]$.

The integration $\tauInt{\fepsim^{n+1}}{\eta}$ is straightforward if the Kronecker-delta
property of the Lagrange polynomials is utilized. 
By Simpson's integration:
\begin{equation}
    \int_\tau\fepsim\eta dx \approx \frac{h_\tau}{2}\left(
        \fepsi_{m,0}\eta(x_0) + 4\fepsi_{m,1}\eta(x_1) + \fepsi_{m,1}\eta(x_2)
        \right)
\end{equation}
The coefficients for the flux at the $j$-th node multiplied by $\eta_i$ for
the kernel of \cref{eq:bilinearC,eq:bilinearD} can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \tauInt{\fepsim}{\eta_i} = \left\lbrace h_\tau\eta_i(x_j)\xi_j\right\rbrace
\end{equation}

Then the coefficients of $\asMatrix{C}$ and $\asMatrix{D}$ are
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:cCoeffs}
        c_{i,j} = \sigma_th_\tau\eta_i(x_j)\xi_j
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:dCoeffs}
        d_{i,j} = \frac{1}{v\Delta t_n}h_\tau\eta_i(x_j)\xi_j
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

For the $\asMatrix{A}$ coefficients, the integration requires a little more work
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \int_\tau\ddx{\fepsi}\eta(x)dx \approx \frac{h_\tau}{2}&\left[
            \eta(x_0)\sum_{j=0}^2\fepsimj\sum_{l=1}^2l\ajl x^{j-1}_0\right. \\
            & \left. +4\eta(x_1)\sum_{j=0}^2\fepsimj\sum_{l=1}^2l\ajl x^{j-1}_1
            +\eta(x_2)\sum_{j=0}^2\fepsimj\sum_{l=1}^2l\ajl x^{j-1}_2
        \right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aCoeffs}
    a_{i,j} = h_\tau\sum_{l=1}^2l\ajl\sum_{p=0}^2\xi_p\eta_i(x_p)x_p^{l-1}
\end{equation}

Since the jump values in \cref{eq:bilinearB} introduce values from the upstream mesh, 
those must be included in the source matrix $\asVector{S^{n+1}}$. 
For the mesh of interest, the $\asMatrix{B}$ matrix depends upon the value of $\mu_m$.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bCoeffs}
    b_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
        \eta_i(x_0)\delta_{j,0},\text{ for }\mu_m > 0 \\
        \eta_i(x_2)\delta_{j,2},\text{ for }\mu_m < 0 \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Using the coefficients defined in \cref{eq:aCoeffs,eq:bCoeffs,eq:cCoeffs,eq:dCoeffs} and 
the test functions defined in \cref{eq:testfuncs}, all the material is in place in order
to solve the linear system\footnote{iteratively, as discussed in \cref{sec:iterations}}
defined in \cref{eq:matrixFEM}.
\subsection{Basic Iteration Scheme} \label{sec:iterations}

\Cref{alg:inner} gives a brief look into the iterations that take for every time-level
$n$.
The special routines that are not detailed in this document, but are listed in 
\Cref{alg:inner} are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $updateSouce$ - \cref{algI:uSource}: Update the scalar flux $\fephi^{(k)}$ using the 
        most recent angular flux coefficients $\fepsimj^{(k-1)}$
    \item $innerSolve$ - \cref{algI:innerSolve}: Solve the linear system from \cref{eq:matrixFEM} at a specfic
        angle using $\fephi^{(k)}$
    \item $convergenceCheck$ - \cref{algI:converge}: Sweep over all meshes and check if the coefficients have
        converged to a reasonable degree $\Delta\approx O(1E-6)$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Inner iteration at time level $n$ - Python-like}

    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $isConverged = False$

\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Using \texttt{fesnt.py}} \label{sec:usage}

Present in the repository are a collection of yaml input files that were used to generate
results for this section.
In particular, there are a few gifs that display the time-evolution of the angular fluxes
for the test problems.
Due to the non-linearity of \cref{eq:ibvpNTE}, an analytic can be found only for the most
trivial of problems.
Therefore, more in-depth analysis will be applied to the pure-absorber problem,
with select snapshots and discussion for two more complicated problems:
a single-media problem that includes scattering and a 
mulit-region problem that includes scattering and fission.
For all problems, the $S_2$ and $S_4$ quadrature sets were used, except for case 3, which 
includes the $S_8$ quadrature set exclusively.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Analytic Solution} \label{sec:analyticSoln}
An analytic solution to \cref{eq:ibvpNTE} was found for the pure absorber case
with $\Gamma_b=0$, $\psi_{m,0}=0$.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:analyticSoln}
    \psi(x,mu,t) = \begin{cases}
        e^{-x\sigma_t/v\mu}\Gamma_a(\mu, t-x/v\mu)u(t-x/v\mu), \text{ for }\mu>0\\
        0, \text{ for }\mu<0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $u(t-x/v\mu)$ is a shifted step function
\begin{equation}
    u(t-a) = \begin{cases}
        0,t<a \\
        1,t>a
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The boundary conditions and domain were chosen as to observe wave propagation through
the media.
This required also reducing the neutron velocity $v$ by a factor of $1E4$, as higher speeds
required very small space-time discretization and induced oscillations.
The boundary condition was defined to be
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:analyticBound}
    \Gamma_a(\mu, t) = \mu sin^2(1000t)
\end{equation}
which yields an analytic solution plotted in \cref{fig:analyticSoln} that contains
some degree of wave propagation over space and time.

The physical domain was taken to be $x\in\Omega\equiv[0, 1]$, $t\in\mathcal{T}\equiv[0,0.01]$ with
100 elements per dimension.

\subsection{Numeric Results} \label{sec:femResults}

\Cref{fig:femCase1} shows the numeric approximation for \cref{eq:analyticSoln}, with comparisons 
made in \cref{fig:relDiffCase1,fig:l2Error}.
The image \texttt{figures/example-pureAbsorber-s4.gif} shows the time-evolution of 
all angular fluxes for this problem.
A prominent difference can be found in the first elements after the boundary, where a jump
in the angular flux occurs. 
This jump is also observed in subsequent cases.

The author has some ideas on what could be causing these issues, and will discuss the 
possibilities in \cref{sec:conclusion}.
The bulk of the wave-front presented in \cref{fig:relDiffCase1} is within 5-10\% of the 
analytic solution, with the majority of the errors occurring after the wave-front
and nearest the boundary source. Possible explanations for this are included in \cref{sec:conclusion}.

Introducing a scattering source does have some effect on damping
the angular fluxes for $\mu>0$, as seen partially in \cref{fig:fluxesScatterS4}, and the
gifs \texttt{figures/example-scattr-s4.gif} and \texttt{figures/example-scattr.gif}.
However, this dissipation does not propagate back into the $\mu<0$ fluxes.

For the multi-regional problem with fission, a similar dampening is observed for positive $\mu$, 
but the source does not dissipate into negative $\mu$ fluxes, as seen in \cref{fig:fluxesMultiReg}.
By viewing the gif \texttt{figures/example-multi-media.gif}, one can also observe the
effect of different media on the damping rates.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

A numeric scheme was presented that solves the one-dimensional monoenergetic neutron transport
equation for a given quadrature set. 
The scheme utilizes a discontinuous-Galerkin approach for the spatial discretization, with
implicit Euler in time.
The method was applied to three problems with increasing difficulty, from a homogeneous pure-absorber 
to a multi-region problem with scattering and fission.
Graphs comparing the pure-absorber to the analytic solution demonstrated modest agreement in some zones,
with some known issues outside the wave-front.
Similarly, the scattering and fission sources did not appear to dissipate into the other directions of
$\phi$.

The most likely contender for these faults, and the jump that was noticed near the boundary, is the 
poor choice in test functions. 
The functions presented in \cref{eq:testfuncs} do not satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions at adjacent node points, nor at the global boundary.
The author became aware of this issue with insufficient time to correct prior to submission.
The author intends to continue this work\footnote{in whatever free time available} in an attempt
to produce a finished product.
An investigation of the reflective boundary conditions will also be undertaken, as the multi-regional
problem did not accurately represent these conditions.

\subsection{Quadrature Sets} \label{sec:qsets}
The following tables contain the quadrature sets that were used in this work and can be found
in \cite{lewis1984computational}.
For each set, only half of the values are presented, as symmetry rules from \cref{eq:quadRules}
can be used to construct the full set.
